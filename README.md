# C-Project-Socket-and-Data-Structures
This project involves creating a client-server application in C for managing contacts. The client connects to the server, authenticates with a login and password, and performs actions based on the user's role (Admin or Guest). The application allows admins to manage contacts and guests to view and search contacts.
